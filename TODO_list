Feature TODO list:

COMMANDS:

# [ ] Add a way to modify customcommands
# [X] Quiz command
         - Ideally, this command would be robust enough to create quizzes, modify quizzes, start quizzes, and show quiz
           stats.
         - Answering quizzes could be in the form of reactions for multiple choice, or using a String comparator
# [ ] Music Player
# [ ] Poll command - conduct polls using message reactions
# [ ] ImportantDates command (would be cool if it only gave upcoming events)
# [ ] Pi command - return pi to n digits
          - Currently in progress (having problems implementing the default Math library)


FLASK:
# [ ] Have flask display Discord stats (such as top contributer, most upvoted etc.)
# [ ] Make a quiz form and have each quiz have its own url (eg '/quiz/<quizobject>'


Other Features:
# [X] Make bot 'autoreact' to certain words (such as prof names)
# [ ] Error catching for all SQL queries (currently nothing happens and it fails with no messaging)
# [ ] Welcome new users with embedded cool looking message
# [ ] Clean up code to remove all "userinput" strings and replace with proper arguments (eg '*, args')
# [ ] All SQL calls must be rewritten to prevent injection (Currently most of them use string building which is bad)
# [ ] Switch over to SQLAlchemy for all SQL
